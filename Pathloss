Pr(dBm) = Pr(d0) + 20log(do/d) 1A
n = (Pr(d0)-(Pr(d))/10*log10(d/do) 1B
1c 
use this formula PL(d)=10*n*log10(d)+7.8−1.8log10(htx)−18log10(hrx)+20log10(fc)
and Pl(d) = Pt - Pr(d)

1D
same formula as 1C just fc is given and Hrx is not given 

1E
same as 1c just u have to find Htx transmitting antenna height instead of hrx
